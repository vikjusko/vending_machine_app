## Instructions: 

We'd like you to design a vending machine that behaves as follows:

* Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product
* It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted
* The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be of denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2
* There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point
* The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains

### As well as the functional requirements on the previous slide we also want your solution to:
* Be written in ruby
* Have tests
* Include a readme - think of it like the description you write on a github PR. Consider: explaining any decisions you made, telling us how to run it if it's not obvious, signposting the best entry point for reviewing it, etc...

The bulk of our score comes from how you completed these functional and non-functional requirements. We also evaluate:
* How idiomatic your ruby code is
* The OO design of your classes and methods
* The simplicity of your solution


### Scoring take home test

* Our engineer will review your completed test

We may do this review "dry" by just looking at the code submission, we may also try and run the tests and implementation to see how it works.

* Our goal is to score each test consistently. We expect a 60% to be a pass, anything 	less is probably a no. Our scorecard would assess the following areas:
* Solving requirements
* Good quality tests
* Follows OOP best practices with good class design and separation
* Correct change calculation
* Writing using Ruby best practices
* Not over-engineering
* Not spending way too long on it
* Good names of classes and methods


### Follow CLEO AI engineering principles: 

* Do the simple thing - Make small changes that deliver business value and test these with our users to get feedback quickly.
* We innovate in our product, not our tech stack - We choose technologies that allow us to make an impact for our users
* Technical debt is useful - The deliberate, conscious and careful accumulation of tech debt is a powerful tool that lets us ship code and value to our users faster. 
* We are considerate coders. We write code to be read by humans, debugged by humans and maintained by humans. 
* We help each other. The output of the team is more important than the output of any individual in that team. If someone is stuck, helping them is the highest-value use of our time.
